# IntegrationMethods
A simple user defined function that combines 5 integration approximation methods, outputting the approximations and relative errors.

Uses rectangle methods (left endpoint, right endpoint, midpoint), trapezoid method, Simpson's 1/3 method*

*note: the UDF for Simpson's 1/3 method (lines 77-85) was slightly modified from 'Numerical Methods for Engineers and Scientists Using MATLAB' 3e by Esfandiari. This is also indicated in the code. Everything else was my contribution.
